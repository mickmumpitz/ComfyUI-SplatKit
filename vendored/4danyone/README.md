<p align="center">4DAnyone turns a casual monocular video into multi-view videos, enabling downstream 4DGS reconstruction.</p>

> [!note]
> 4DAnyone is a multi-view video model that:
>
> - generates dozens of synchronized, view-consistent videos from a single monocular video.
> - requires **22 GB** of peak CUDA memory, enabling inference on consumer GPUs.
> - generates a 121-frame video in **27 seconds** on a single RTX 4090.

## News

- **2026-09-05**: Reduced peak GPU memory below **24 GB**, enabling inference on consumer GPUs (RTX 4090).
- **2026-09-02**: Released **4DAnyone-Turbo**, achieving a **5.58×** denoising speedup over 4DAnyone-Base.
- **2026-08-28**: Achieved a **1.42×** end-to-end speedup for the complete 24-view generation pipeline.
- **2026-08-28**: Reduced peak GPU memory below **32 GB** while slightly improving speed.

## Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ant-research/4DAnyone.git
cd 4DAnyone

conda create -n 4danyone python=3.11 -y
conda activate 4danyone
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

For faster inference, optionally install [FlashAttention-3](https://github.com/Dao-AILab/flash-attention/tree/main/hopper) or [SageAttention](https://github.com/thu-ml/SageAttention). The installed backend is enabled automatically.

Body pose comes from **SAM 3D Body**, which ships inside ComfyUI. Point the pipeline at a
ComfyUI checkout and its interpreter:

```bash
export FDANYONE_SAM3D_COMFY_ROOT=/path/to/ComfyUI
export FDANYONE_SAM3D_PYTHON=/path/to/ComfyUI/python
```

The weights are resolved from `models/detection/sam_3d_body_dinov3_bf16.safetensors` inside
that checkout, downloadable from [`Comfy-Org/sam-3d-body`](https://huggingface.co/Comfy-Org/sam-3d-body),
and can be overridden with `FDANYONE_SAM3D_WEIGHTS`.

Missing models and examples are downloaded automatically on first use. You can also download them manually:

```bash
python scripts/download_model.py
python scripts/download_example.py
```

There is no registration step and no manual body-model download. SAM 3D Body and MHR
replaced GVHMR and SMPL-X, which were research-only and non-commercial respectively; see
`docs/THIRD_PARTY_NOTICES.md`.

## Inference

This repository provides two models: **4DAnyone-Base** with the standard denoising schedule and the distilled **4DAnyone-Turbo** for faster four-step denoising. 4DAnyone-Turbo is enabled by default for faster inference while maintaining generation quality comparable to 4DAnyone-Base. See [Inference performance](docs/inference_performance.md) for GPU memory, inference speed, and generation quality benchmarks.

4DAnyone supports flexible target-view counts, pitch layers, and yaw coverage. Here are several common camera configurations:

### 6-View Full Orbit

A compact 360° layout for basic coverage. Start here for an initial test.

```bash
python inference.py \
    --video_path "data/source/pexels/2785536-uhd_2160_3840_25fps.mp4" \
    --views_per_layer 6
```

<p align="left"><img src="docs/assets/inference-6-views.jpg" width="600" alt="Six evenly spaced target cameras on one full orbit"></p>

### 24-View Full Orbit

A dense 360° layout with broad angular coverage, suitable for 4DGS reconstruction.

```bash
python inference.py \
    --video_path "data/source/pexels/2785536-uhd_2160_3840_25fps.mp4" \
    --views_per_layer 24
```

<p align="left"><img src="docs/assets/inference-24-views.jpg" width="600" alt="Twenty-four evenly spaced target cameras on one full orbit"></p>

### 48-View Full Orbit, Three Pitch Layers

This layout distributes views across three pitch rings for broader coverage, enabling free-viewpoint 4DGS rendering.

```bash
python inference.py \
    --video_path "data/source/pexels/2785536-uhd_2160_3840_25fps.mp4" \
    --views_per_layer 16 --layer_pitches '[-10,15,35]'
```

<p align="left"><img src="docs/assets/inference-48-views-3-layers.jpg" width="600" alt="Forty-eight target cameras arranged over three pitch layers"></p>

### 24-View Frontal Arc, Two Pitch Layers

A two-layer layout for dense coverage across the frontal 180° arc.

```bash
python inference.py \
    --video_path "data/source/pexels/2785536-uhd_2160_3840_25fps.mp4" \
    --views_per_layer 12 --layer_pitches '[0,30]' --start_yaw -90 --yaw_span 180
```

<p align="left"><img src="docs/assets/inference-24-views-front-180.jpg" width="600" alt="Twenty-four target cameras distributed over two pitch layers along the frontal 180-degree arc"></p>

### Key Arguments

Run `python inference.py --help` for the full list.

- `views_per_layer`: number of evenly spaced views per pitch layer. It must be divisible by 4 or 6.
- `layer_pitches`: pitch angles in degrees, one per layer. Positive values place cameras above the subject. Total views are `views_per_layer × len(layer_pitches)`.
- `start_yaw`: horizontal angle of the first view, in degrees. Yaw `0` is the front view.
- `yaw_span`: horizontal range covered by each camera layer, in degrees.
- `gpu_ids`: GPU IDs used for parallel pose/VAE view stages and target denoising. Defaults to all visible GPUs.
- `enable_turbo`: whether to use 4DAnyone-Turbo. Enabled by default.

### Output

With the default `--data_dir data`, results follow this layout. See the [output documentation](docs/output.md) for the complete format.
